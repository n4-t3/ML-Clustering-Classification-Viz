# Interactive Machine Learning Visualization Tool

An interactive web-based tool for visualizing how different machine learning algorithms work. This educational tool allows users to create data points on a coordinate plane and see how various algorithms classify or cluster the data.

[Try the demo on github](https://n4-t3.github.io/ML-Clustering-Classification-Viz/)

## How It Works

1. **Add data points** by clicking on the coordinate plane
2. **Toggle point class** using the "Class 1" and "Class -1" buttons
3. **Select an algorithm** from the dropdown menu
4. **Click "Run"** to see the visualization
5. **Click "Reset"** to start over
